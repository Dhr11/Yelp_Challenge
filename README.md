# Yelp_Challenge-
Our project goal is to recommend businesses to users.  There are various techniques to implementthis task.  We have divided our approaches into Task 1 and Task 2.  In the first task we aim to rec-ommend businesses to users based on Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and Neural AttentionalRating Regression with Review-level Explanations and compare the results between them.  In thesecond task, we decided to predict whether a review is useful or not.
