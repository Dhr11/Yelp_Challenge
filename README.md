### Yelp_Challenge-
Our project goal is to recommend businesses to users.  There are various techniques to implementthis task.  We have divided our approaches into Task 1 and Task 2.  

In the first task we aim to recommend businesses to users based on Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and Neural Attentional Rating Regression with Review-level Explanations and compare the results between them.  

In the second task, we decided to predict whether a review is useful or not. We have used traditional ML algorithms and bi-directional LSTM architecture on reviews and few other important user business features for the same.
