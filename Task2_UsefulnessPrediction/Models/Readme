  
  We have used 3 methods:
  
  1. Machine Learning techniques (KNN, Random Forest)
  2. Using Text Data to predict usefulness
  3. Using Text Data, Category Vector and Extra Features Vector to predict usefulness

  We have used the website below to obtain the glove and crawl files needed for generating the embedding matrix for text data:
